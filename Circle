//Create the following class as stated:

//A class called circle is designed as shown in the following class diagram. It contains:
//• Two private instance variables: radius (of the type double) and color (of the type
//String), with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.
//• Two overloaded constructors - a default constructor with no argument, and a
//constructor which takes a double argument for radius.
//• Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea(), which return the radius and area of
//this instance, respectively.
